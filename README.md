# Introduction to REST

## Objectives

1. Explain the history of REST
2. Explain the main actions involved in RESTful architectures
3. Describe the relationship between REST and HTTP

## Introduction

We can use https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/rails-intro-to-rest as a template

I would love to see this lesson be as generic as possible

We should talk about REST as it relates to CRUD especially

But also as it relates to API design
